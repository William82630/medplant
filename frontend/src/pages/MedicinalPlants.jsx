        protection long before modern medicine emerged. Today, renewed global 
        interest in natural wellness, holistic health, and plant-based therapies 
        has brought medicinal plants back into the spotlight—supported not just 
        by traditional wisdom but also by modern scientific research.

        immunity, improve digestion, and promote whole-body healing.
